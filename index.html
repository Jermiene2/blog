    <h1>Journey Through Computing: From Ancient Tools to Modern Technology</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Hey there! Have you ever wondered how computers developed from large machines that required entire rooms to the today’s mobile phones? Let us follow the path through the origin of computing and discover the IT concepts underlying the contemporary societies.
    </p>

    <h2>Early Beginnings: Computers and the Emergence of Civilization</h2>
    <p>
        The first counting device that we will discuss is the <strong>abacus</strong>, a bead-operated counting tool. In the early 17th century, <strong>Blaise Pascal</strong> developed the <strong>Pascaline</strong>, a machine used for calculating mathematical problems such as taxation. Later, the use of mechanisms in computation was popularized by <strong>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</strong> using the <strong>Step Reckoner</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>The Advent of Electronic Computers</h2>
    <p>
        Towards the 1940s, improvements in computers were observed. Digital computers, which performed calculations at a slow rate, were replaced by the large <strong>Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC)</strong>, designed for complex calculations. The <strong>UNIVAC</strong> arrived in 1951 as the first computer actually built and marketed for business use, signifying a very crucial stage in the development of computers.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Technological Advances: Transistors and Microprocessors</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>transistor</strong> is a semiconductor device used to either increase or rectify electrical signals and power. In the mid-20th century, particularly during the 1940s and 1950s, transistors replaced heavy vacuum tubes, leading to the design of smaller, more reliable, and power-efficient computers. The 1970s saw the advent of the <strong>microprocessor</strong>, which integrated the central processing unit into a microchip, paving the way for present-day personal computers.
    </p>

    <h2>The Rise of Personal Computing</h2>
    <p>
        The 1980s saw the growing importance of personal computing. In 1981, <strong>IBM</strong> introduced the <strong>IBM PC</strong>, making computers accessible to the public. At the same time, <strong>Apple</strong> released the <strong>Macintosh</strong> with a new graphical user interface (GUI), further popularizing personal computers.
    </p>

    <h2>The Internet Era: Connecting the World</h2>
    <p>
        In the 1960s, <strong>ARPANET</strong> appeared, which can be considered as the embryo of the internet, created by the U.S. Department of Defense. In 1991, <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> introduced the <strong>World Wide Web (WWW)</strong> in Britain, changing the way people think and deal with information: online shopping, social networks, etc.
    </p>

    <h2>Impact on Society</h2>
    <p>
        Nowadays, technology is integrated into business, technology, and everyday life. In <strong>business</strong>, it performs functions mechanically and facilitates the dissemination of information. In <strong>technology</strong>, it enhances education and research. In <strong>everyday life</strong>, people depend on devices like smartphones and social media for connectivity and entertainment.
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction to IT Basics</h2>
    <p><strong>1. Hardware Essentials:</strong></p>
    <p>
        - <strong>CPU:</strong> The computer’s hardware indispensable component for the processing of instructions through the arithmetic and logic unit.<br>
        - <strong>RAM:</strong> Temporary storage or swift storage for data which is in frequent use.<br>
        - <strong>Storage Devices:</strong> Large data storage devices like HDDs and faster and secure storage devices like SSDs.<br>
        - <strong>Peripherals:</strong> Input and output devices such as keyboards, mice, and printers.
    </p>
    <p><strong>2. Understanding Software:</strong></p>
    <p>
        - <strong>Operating Systems:</strong> Operating systems such as Windows, macOS, or Linux that govern the hardware.<br>
        - <strong>Applications:</strong> Facilities like MS Word for writing documents or Google Chrome for browsing.
    </p>
    <p><strong>3. Basics of Networking:</strong></p>
    <p>
        - <strong>Internet:</strong> A worldwide system which links computers in order to exchange information.<br>
        - <strong>LAN:</strong> A set of wired or wireless links that bind devices in a given environment such as home or office.<br>
        - <strong>Protocols:</strong> Protocols such as TCP/IP for data transmission.
    </p>
    <p><strong>4. Role of IT in Organizations:</strong></p>
    <p>
        - <strong>Business Operations:</strong> IT addresses automation support as well as data management.<br>
        - <strong>Cybersecurity:</strong> Controls risks that threaten data as well as systems in an organization.<br>
        - <strong>Innovation:</strong> Leads to new technologies and solutions.
    </p>
    <p><strong>5. Emerging Technologies:</strong></p>
    <p>
        - <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</strong> Human-like robots or artificial intelligence.<br>
        - <strong>Cloud Computing:</strong> Online facilities for scalable and flexible computing.<br>
        - <strong>Internet of Things (IoT):</strong> Incorporating devices into the web for sharing data.
    </p>
